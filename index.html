    <h1>Should You Build Your Own PC?</h1>
      <p>Building a personal computer, or PC, from scratch is a regular practice done by individuals interested in customizing their machines to their liking. This is done as opposed to purchasing a prebuilt PC, which are computers already assembled by their manufacturers. Before committing to your technological journey, assess yourself. Does building a PC suit your interests? Do you find the potential drawbacks negligible?</p>
    
    <h2>Benefits to Building a PC:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>More customization</li>
        <li>Cost-efficient</li>
        <li>Better cooling</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>Drawbacks to Building a PC:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Requires technical knowledge of computer components</li>
      <li>Takes a learning curve</li>
      <li>Time-consuming</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>PC Parts</h1>
    <p>After deciding whether or not you want to embark on the adventure that is building your own computer, here is an overview of some components. Many of you are already aware of their functions, but included are summaries for those who forgot or weren't knowledgeable in the first place.</p>
    <h3>Processing</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Central Processing Unit (CPU) - The <em>"brain"</em> of the computer that performs mathematical calculations.</li>
        <li>Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) - Processes the computer's <strong>graphical</strong> outputs.</li>
        <li>Motherboard - A circuit board that houses computer parts, allowing them to communicate with each other.</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Memory</h3>
      <ul>
      <li>Long-term Storage</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Hard Disk Drive (HDD) - Cheaper, but typically slow and bulky. Because of their low price per gigabyte, they are best suited for budget PC builds or large storage.</li>
        <li>Solid State Drive (SSD) - More expensive, but faster and lightweight. Best suited for performance and computer longevity, as they last longer on average compared to Hard Disk Drives.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Random Access Memory (RAM) - The computer's volatile, short-term memory.</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Energy</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Power Supply Unit (PSU) - Converts the main AC power from the wall outlet to the appropriate DC power used to activate computer components.</li>
        <li>Heat Sink and Fan (HSF) - Regulates the temperatures of computer parts by blowing out hot air and taking in cool air.</li>
        <li>Case - Holds all the computer components together.</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Input / Output (IO)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Keyboard - Communicates the user's key inputs to the computer.</li>
        <li>Mouse - Translates the user's movement of the device into motions to control the digital cursor on a computer.</li>
        <li>Monitor - Displays the graphical output of a computer.</li>
        <li>Speakers - Generates sound from a computer.</li>
      </ul>
