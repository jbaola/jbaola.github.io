    <h1>Should You Build Your Own PC?</h1>
    <p>Building a personal computer, or PC, from scratch is a regular practice done by individuals interested in customizing their machines to their liking. This is done as opposed to purchasing a prebuilt PC, which are computers already assembled by their manufacturers. Before committing to your technological journey, assess yourself. Does building a PC suit <em>your</em> interests? Do <em>you</em> find the potential drawbacks negligible?</p>
    
    <h2>Benefits to Building a PC:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>More customization</li>
        <li>Cost-efficient</li>
        <li>Better cooling</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>Drawbacks to Building a PC:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Requires technical knowledge of computer components</li>
      <li>Takes a learning curve</li>
      <li>Time-consuming</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>PC Parts</h1>
    <p>After deciding whether or not you want to embark on the adventure that is building your own computer, here is an overview of some components. Many of you are already aware of their functions, but included are summaries for those who forgot or weren't knowledgeable in the first place.</p>
    <h3>Processing</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Central Processing Unit (CPU) - The <em>"brain"</em> of the computer that performs mathematical calculations.</li>
        <li>Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) - Processes the computer's <strong>graphical</strong> outputs.</li>
        <li>Motherboard - A circuit board that houses computer parts, allowing them to communicate with each other.</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Memory</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Long-term Storage</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Hard Disk Drive (HDD) - Cheaper, but typically slow and bulky. Because of their low price per gigabyte, they are best suited for budget PC builds or large storage.</li>
            <li>Solid State Drive (SSD) - More expensive, but faster and lightweight. Best suited for performance and computer longevity, as they last longer on average compared to Hard Disk Drives.</li>
          </ul>
        <li>Random Access Memory (RAM) - The computer's volatile, short-term memory.</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Energy</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Power Supply Unit (PSU) - Converts the main AC power from the wall outlet to the appropriate DC power used to activate computer components.</li>
        <li>Heat Sink and Fan (HSF) - Regulates the temperatures of computer parts by blowing out hot air and taking in cool air.</li>
        <li>Case - Holds all the computer components together.</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Input / Output (IO)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Keyboard - Communicates the user's key inputs to the computer.</li>
        <li>Mouse - Translates the user's movement of the device into motions to control the digital cursor on a computer.</li>
        <li>Monitor - Displays the graphical output of a computer.</li>
        <li>Speakers - Generates sound from a computer.</li>
      </ul>

    <h1>Choosing PC Parts: Budgets</h1>
    <p>After learning about each computer component, it is now time to choose your parts. Price is a <strong>crucial</strong> factor to not only performance but also aesthetic. For example, a $1,000 PC would perform differently from a $5,000 PC. The reasoning behind this is clear: the better the performance, the more expensive the part. This pattern also applies to the computer's appearance. Having a higher budget paves the way for more customization. With this in mind, choosing the price range for your PC should be off the basis of your interests and needs, such as if you're using it for gaming as opposed to for work. Below is a list of recommended budgets, their capabilities, and who they might appeal to.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Budget: $500 - $750</li>
          <ul>
            <li>May appeal to individuals who are on a tight budget or unconcerned about the performance or aesthetics of their PC.</li>
            <li>Capable of processing basic computational and graphical tasks.</li>
            <li>Able to run simple video games, but may encounter issues for more demanding ones.</li>
          </ul>
        <li>Mid-Range: $750 - $1500</li>
          <ul>
            <li>May appeal to the average computer user.</li>
            <li>Able to run more demanding games smoothly.</li>
            <li>A middle ground between budget and high-end builds.</li>
          </ul>
      <li>High-End: >$1500</li>
        <ul>
          <li>May appeal to individuals focused on computer performance.</li>
          <li>Might interest gamers in need of more powerful components to run video games with higher graphics smoothly.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>

    <h1>Choosing PC Parts: Aesthetics</h1>
      <p>If you are going to build a PC, you might as well make it look nice. Luckily, there are many ways to customize your build. Below are some examples.<p>
      <ul>
        <li>Following a general color scheme - Since most computer parts come in either black and white, choosing one of the colors to base your build on can create a satisfying color composition.</li>
        <li>RGB - As the name implies, these gears <strong>illuminate</strong> your computer with <span style="animation: color-change 1s infinite">vibrant colors.</span></li>
      </ul>
